 Deep learning course activities

## Activity 1: Activations and forward pass in a neural network, CC6204 Deep Learning, Universidad de Chile

The goal of this activity is to implement a neural network with forward propagation. The network is tested with a data set corresponding to images of handwritten numbers and with pre-trained parameters.  




## Activity 2: Backpropagation, gradient descent and training
CC6204 Deep Learning, University of Chile

In this activity, backpropagation will be programmed for the specific case of the networks that were built in Activity1. In addition, the network will be trained with gradient descent, which will also be implemented by hand.
